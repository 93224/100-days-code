# 🚀 100 Days of Code – Java DSA Journey  

This repository documents my **100 Days of Code challenge** where I solve **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** problems daily in **Java**.  
The goal is to build strong problem-solving skills, consistency, and prepare for coding interviews.

## 📌 Progress Tracker  

✅ **Day 1** – Implemented Selection Sort  
✅ **Day 2** – Implemented Insertion Sort  
✅ **Day 3** – Program to Find Max and Min in Array  
✅ **Day 4** – Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) in Binary Tree  
... *(more days coming!)*
